Initially the application takes:
    178MB of rss
    111MB of heapTotal
    86MB of heapUsed
    3MB of external
    1MB of arrayBuffers
After creating 6500 vehicles the application takes:
    201MB of rss
    136MB of heapTotal
    104MB of heapUsed
    3MB of external
    1MB of arrayBuffers
Lets create some vehicles flyweights directly to see what happens
After creating 100 flyweights finally the application takes:
    1122MB of rss
    1055MB of heapTotal
    1019MB of heapUsed
    3MB of external
    1MB of arrayBuffers
